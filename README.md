# Light Bright React Challenge
FreeCodeCamp provides challenges such as this Take Home Project under their Coding Interview Prep Curriculum.

## Build a Light-Bright App
* **Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/eyLYXE.
* **Rule #1:** Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
* **Rule #2:** Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

**User Stories**
1. User Story: I can click or drag the mouse cursor to color the circles.
1. User Story: I can double-click on a colored circle to remove the color.
1. User Story: I can click on a colored circle to change its color.
1. User Story: I should get a circle of different color on each click.
1. User Story: I can click on the 'Reset' button to remove the recent color.
1. User Story: I can click on the 'Reset All' button to remove all the colors from the circles.

## Tools
**User Interface**
For the user interface, I have chosen to use what I know best:
* ReactJS
* Material UI
* SCSS

## Project Plan
